        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "Adding interactivity to an article is a great way to help readers explore the concepts and data you are presenting more deeply. There are three ways to add interactive components to Quarto documents:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  Create custom JavaScript visualizations using [Observable JS](ojs/).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Use the [Shiny](shiny/) R package to add interactivity to Knitr engine documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Incorporate [Jupyter Widgets](widgets/jupyter.qmd) or [htmlwidgets](widgets/htmlwidgets.qmd) (for the Jupyter and Knitr engines, respectively) into your document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of these techniques has distinct benefits and drawbacks in terms of expressiveness, ease of development, and deployment requirements. We'll touch on these considerations briefly below, then provide links to more in depth documentation for learning more.\n",

        "## Observable JS\n",
        "\n",
        "Quarto includes native support for [Observable JS](https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javascript), a set of enhancements to vanilla JavaScript created by [Mike Bostock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Bostock) (also the author of [D3](https://d3js.org/)). Observable JS is distinguished by its [reactive runtime](https://github.com/observablehq/runtime), which is especially well suited for interactive data exploration and analysis.\n",
